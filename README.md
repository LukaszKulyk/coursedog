Hello, thaks for giving me chance to complete this task even when I was late last time! Below you will find few informations ablout the code.

Problems:
I have had a problem beacuse two stories from this task https://coursedog1.notion.site/Recruitment-Task-QA-Engineer-Coursedog-cd22e53b774a46d3867a57419ba26f13 were no longer valid. I was not able to reproduce this steps one by one, that's why I decided to make some changes. This changes are mostly about counting how many events are being displayed but also selecting proper dates to find proper events. I decided to select differet date for my second test just to have some event.


About the code:
There are two test cases to verify each of stories from the task. All the code (xpaths and functions) can be found in utils folder where I have prepared few files in let's say 'component object pattern'. This is my own vision and it is possible that it could be done better.

I have prepared only selectors and functions which I needed to complete this task.

I would appreciate any feedback (good and bad as well).
